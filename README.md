Designing my own language derived from C++ and building a parser for it using Flex and Bison.

The analyzer will check if the words are part of the defined grammar and will check the specified rules, returning the first error if it occurs, and if there are no errors it will build the FIP and the TS for the input.

There is also a NASM code generator for a simplified version of my language.
